His early career decision at such a young age was determined by a tragic passing of his father, after which he dearly wanted to help his mother to hold up the household. One of the main reasons he enjoys the kitchen life the most is because both of his parents were in the restaurant industry - while his father used to also be a chef, his mother was a cook. As of today he is very proud to continue their line of work as a chef and founder of SGJ. Chef Jemiko started his career as an assistant in the kitchen to some of the greatest chefs in the world.
