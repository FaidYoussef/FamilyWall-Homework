At SUGARFISH, you’ll experience sushi as Nozawa has intended, and you’ll find that we do some things differently. An important point about Nozawa-style sushi is his strict adherence to traditional sushi: You’ll find no California rolls, spicy tuna rolls, or teriyaki at SUGARFISH. Chef Nozawa believes the sushi experience should be pure and simple. We want to build on that foundation for our guests. We focus, first and foremost, on the quality of our ingredients. In order to consistently maintain that focus without excessive costs, we also concentrate on simplicity. We want dining at SUGARFISH to be easy and friendly for all of our guests. You could simply follow Chef Nozawa’s mantra: “Don’t Think. Just Eat",

After working in the financial industry for a few years, they noticed an opportunity in the market relating to their love of baked goods: a demand for high-quality, artisanal Swedish sourdough bread. The time was right for the next step in their careers, and they opened up their first bakery. Within four months a second shop was up and running, and following this success there are now multiple bakeries in Sweden, London, and New York. Fabrique’s core values of quality, patience, genuineness, and authenticity permeate every part of the business globally as well as locally, and a careful selection of only the best ingredients ensures an outstanding experience from morning til noon.

Sharing these delights with her colleagues, she was struck by a revelation: her true bliss lay in the smiles her brownies evoked. With a heart full of passion and a kitchen too small for dreams so big, she embarked on a journey far from Wall Street's cacophony. In her humble abode, she baked, wrapped, and personally delivered each brownie, infusing every batch with love. Her creations bore the hallmark of her handcrafted logo and labels, heralding the dawn of a quaint brownie boutique.  A brownie phenomenon: The narrative took a serendipitous turn when Chelsea Market, a renowned culinary haven in New York, extended an invitation to this spirited entrepreneur.

Hani was Miro’s special name for his mother, an endearment only he called her by. Hani’s cakes were so famous, she quickly became the unofficial maker of all birthday cakes in the small town they lived in. Part of it was that his mother adored sweet things herself. Baking was an escape, a moment of joy and reprieve amidst a hard day’s work on the family farm. It had been Hani’s dream to open a bakery of her own, but a geopolitical war and an unexpected diagnosis of terminal cancer laid waste to her plans. Miro was twenty one when his mother died. Hani’s in the East Village is his pledge to her, a silent promise fulfilled. Located in Astor Place, across from The Cooper Union, Hani’s is an open, welcoming space where we hope to showcase our child-like love and joy for baking.

His early career decision at such a young age was determined by a tragic passing of his father, after which he dearly wanted to help his mother to hold up the household. One of the main reasons he enjoys the kitchen life the most is because both of his parents were in the restaurant industry - while his father used to also be a chef, his mother was a cook. As of today he is very proud to continue their line of work as a chef and founder of SGJ. Chef Jemiko started his career as an assistant in the kitchen to some of the greatest chefs in the world.

An important point about Nozawa-style sushi is his strict adherence to traditional sushi: You’ll find no California rolls, spicy tuna rolls, or teriyaki at SUGARFISH. Chef Nozawa believes the sushi experience should be pure and simple. We want to build on that foundation for our guests. We focus, first and foremost, on the quality of our ingredients. In order to consistently maintain that focus without excessive costs, we also concentrate on simplicity. We want dining at SUGARFISH to be easy and friendly for all of our guests.

In 2021, Proof Bakery entered into a new era: It is now a worker cooperative owned and managed by the working employees of the bakery. Since opening the bakery in 2010, Na Young Ma’s goal was to create an inclusive, sustainable environment for everyone who works at the bakery.  For over two years, Na Young and a group of employees worked together to assess, dream up, and craft an equitable model of ownership.
